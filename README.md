# Memory Game
The final project for my Grade 11 Computer Science course. I developed a simple memory game and decided I wanted to learn to incorporate my own graphics,
so I pixelated pictures of people in my life and used them as the "cards" for the game. The most memorable part of this project was definitely the graphics, 
as I had never used pictures in Windows Forms and thus had to learn.
